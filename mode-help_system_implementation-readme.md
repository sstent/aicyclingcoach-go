## Purpose
This mode focuses on implementing a comprehensive help system that provides keyboard shortcut guidance and contextual assistance throughout the application. The help system must be accessible from any screen and adapt to the current context.

## Key Features

- Context-sensitive help content based on active screen
- Keyboard shortcut cheatsheet organized by functionality
- Responsive layout that works in various terminal sizes
- Search functionality for help topics (future enhancement)

## Integration Points
- [`internal/tui/app.go`](fitness-tui/internal/tui/app.go) - Global key handling
- [`internal/tui/screens/help.go`](fitness-tui/internal/tui/screens/help.go) - Main help screen
- [`internal/tui/components/help_panel.go`](fitness-tui/internal/tui/components/help_panel.go) - Reusable help component

## Dependencies
- Requires screen-specific help content definitions
- Relies on bubbletea for screen management

## Expected Outcomes
- Consistent help experience across all application screens
- Intuitive keyboard navigation within help system
- Contextual help that explains current screen functionality
- Comprehensive test coverage for help navigation
